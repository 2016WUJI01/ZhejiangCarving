        <div class="qingtian-row-body">
          Qingtian stone carving is a traditional art form of Qingtian County,
          Zhejiang Province, and is one of the national intangible cultural
          heritages.
          <br />
          Qingtian stone carving began 5000 years ago during the "Siongze
          Culture". During the Tang and Song dynasties, there were breakthroughs
          in subject matter and technique. During the Five Dynasties period, the
          subject matter became more widespread and became an object of
          religious activity. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, Qingtian stone
          carving became a high level of round carving. During the Qing dynasty,
          Qingtian stone carvings absorbed the art of "jade carving" and
          pioneered the art of "multi-level hollowing". Qingtian stone carving
          has become a school of its own, with a spirited atmosphere, delicate
          and exquisite forms, and a realistic, yet still meaningful tone.

        <div class="qingtian-row-title">Historical origins</div>
        <div class="qingtian-row-body">
          Qingtian stone carvings have a long history. In the Zhejiang Museum
          there are four small pigs carved in Qingtian stone from the Six
          Dynasties, which were burial objects at the time. Although simple and
          rugged in form, the pigs are a record of the history of stone carving
          in Qingtian over 1500 years ago. The simplicity of the lines, the
          simplicity of the form, the simplicity of the shape, and the
          combination of form and spirit are all evident in the art of the Han
          and Wei dynasties.
          <br />
          During the Tang and Song dynasties, stone carving in Qingtian
          developed. The Qingtian stone sculptures found in the twin pagodas of
          Longquan from the Wu-Yue period of the Five Dynasties show that there
          was a breakthrough in the subject matter and technique of Qingtian
          stone carving in the Tang dynasty. During the Song dynasty, Qingtian
          stone sculptures absorbed the techniques of 'jade carving', using the
          techniques of 'modelling by situation' and 'taking advantage of the
          colour, quality and carvability of Qingtian stone'. The technique of
          'multi-layered hollowing' was pioneered. Multi-layered carving is a
          characteristic of Qingtian stone carving.
          <br />
          During the Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, Qingtian
          stone carving was repeatedly chosen as a tribute as a famous product
          of Jiangnan. For the 80th birthday of the Qianlong emperor, the
          ministers used Qingtian stone carvings to make a set of 60 seals (now
          in the Palace Museum in Beijing) as a birthday gift. With the opening
          of ocean trade, Qingtian stone carvings were exported to Britain, the
          United States and France, and participated in many international
          competitions, winning prizes at the Paris Competition in 1899, the
          Belgium Competition in 1905 and the Pacific Exposition in the United
          States in 1915. In China, in 1909, Qingtian stone carvings won a
          silver medal at the Nanyang Persuasion in Nanjing.
          <br />
          After the founding of New China, Qingtian stone carving has developed
          rapidly, with more than 10,000 people working in the field and an
          annual output of hundreds of millions of yuan, and works exported to
          over 40 countries and regions.

          The carving technique of Qingtian stone carving is divided into
          several types, including round carving, openwork, relief carving and
          line carving, with round carving being the most common and openwork
          carving being the most characteristic. In practice, round carving and
          relief carving are used to outline the outline of the scene with the
          tip of a slanting knife after the layout, and a flat knife to cut and
          scrape the remaining stone surface, then a shallow carving with a
          knife to show the structure and layers of the scene. "Line carving" is
          to use a knife instead of a pen to carve out the shaded lines on the
          stone carving. It is mainly used in the beard and hair of people,
          costume patterns, animal fur and scales, the corrugated houses of
          landscapes, the leaf tendons of flowers, and the decorative patterns
          on stove bottles and boxes, to achieve a striking effect. Openwork is
          widely used in carving landscapes and flowers, making the work rich in
          layers and exquisite in clarity. There are two main stages: the
          placing of the holes and the hollowing. The hole is used to create the
          conditions for hollowing; hollowing is done on the basis of the hole,
          after chiselling, knifing and stabbing, so that the round hole becomes
          a space of variable form outside the entity, which can make the work
          rich in layers and exquisite.

          Qingtian stone carving is favoured by the world not only for its
          exquisite carving art, but also for the preciousness of its carrier,
          Qingtian stone. Qingtian stone carving is a national culture of
          excellence created by generations of stone artists and admirers alike,
          an art with life and soul. In the self-promotion of functional
          aestheticisation, some aesthetic tendencies turned out to be stronger,
          or their utilitarian focus on the spiritual will rather than the
          material function of the original form, and its value transformation
          appears more natural and fluid, and more favoured by modern people.
          <br />
          The rich content and theoretical guidance value of Qingtian stone
          carving is the essence of traditional craft culture, and is of great
          significance for the construction of a material culture with Chinese
          characteristics in the 21st century.
