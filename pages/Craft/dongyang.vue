          Dongyang wood carving originated in Dongyang, Zhejiang Province, and
          has a history of over a thousand years since the Tang Dynasty, making
          it an excellent representative of Chinese folk carving art. In 2006,
          Dongyang wood carving was approved by the State Council to be included
          in the first batch of national intangible cultural heritage list. From
          the earliest production of wooden figurines, to architectural
          decoration of palaces, temples and houses, to modern ornaments,
          furniture, wall hangings and interior design, etc., this art has
          evolved and innovated through the millennia, showing great vitality
          under the inheritance and promotion of generations of wood carving
          artists. By the end of 2019, Dongyang had three Asia Pacific
          handicraft masters, more than 50 national and provincial arts and
          crafts masters, and over 3,000 professionals of all kinds.

      <div class="dongyang-row-body">
        Dongyang wood carving is a planar relief carving with a scattered
        perspective, and its carving materials are widely used, because of the
        fine carving, generally less lacquer, highlighting the original taste of
        the original wood, also known as "white wood carving". The materials
        used in Dongyang wood carving are mainly divided into: the content of
        the subject matter carved with materials and the border with materials.
        The content of the carving material requires delicate wood grain,
        durable, non-greasy, not easy to deformation, not easy to crack, such as
        camphor, linden, poplar, birch, white wood, white mahogany, ginkgo wood,
        nan wood, beech wood and other light-coloured wood, suitable for the
        fine carving of Dongyang wood carving. For the border material, the wood
        is required to be tough, hard and heavy. It is not easily damaged and
        plays a reinforcing and backing role. Such as ebony, sourwood, mahogany,
        pearwood, iron pearwood, etc. The materials chosen should make use of
        the natural colour and texture of the wood, so that the structural
        content of the work is integrated with the outer frame shape. The colour
        and texture of the wood carving material is the "skin" of wood carving,
        wood carving works after carving, giving the language of carving, its
        material gives a certain material language, can deepen the infectious
        power of wood carving art.
        <br />
        In recent years, Dongyang wood carving in the choice of carving
        materials, whether it is the border, or the main carving part, all use
        high-grade materials for carving production, such as the use of
        small-leaf rosewood, large-leaf rosewood, sourwood, pearwood,
        golden-wood, red bean fir and other high-grade wood for carving
        production. The aim is to enhance the economic value of wood carvings
        through the carving of high-grade materials. However, as far as the
        artistic expression of fine carving is concerned, there is no effect of
        lighter colours.

      <div class="dongyang-row-body">
        The composition of a Dongyang wood carving is the author's idea and
        intention to express the theme of thought through the reasonable
        arrangement of graphics to form a complete picture, to achieve the
        expression of the mood, the content of the work of art. The composition
        is the skeleton of the entire work of Dongyang wood carving, and is the
        carrier of the intention. The composition should include the mood,
        content and method of expression, which has an important relationship
        with the success of the creation of the work and the overall artistic
        effect. In the composition, the part of the theme that can attract the
        viewer's attention should be fully expressed, and the accompanying
        objects should be handled in a general way, so that the accompanying
        objects can play a role in the artistic effect. The work of Dongyang
        wood carving is to choose things that one is more familiar with and
        feels more deeply about, and to express one's thoughts and emotions and
        thematic content, as well as one's opinions on art, fully through the
        vehicle of wood carving.
        <br />
        Dongyang wood carvings are full of composition, rich in expressive
        content, well delineated and layered, and appropriately reserved for
        flat surfaces, with the artistic effect of viewing the big picture in a
        small way. Within a certain plane and space, it can express a richer
        content than Western relief carvings. The composition of Dongyang wood
        carvings can be summarised as a scattered perspective approach to
        composition, which is based on several aspects such as the combination
        of line and surface modelling techniques, the appropriate retention of
        flat surfaces, small pieces of reserved land and the high and far
        overlapping layers of treatment.
        <br />
        The composition of Dongyang wood carvings is characterised by a high,
        distant, flat and scattered level of perspective and by the traditional
        Chinese painting of scattered perspective or bird's-eye perspective,
        which can be richer than that of Western relief carvings, and can be
        free from the "large near and small far", "scene clear "It is not bound
        by the rules of Western carving and painting, such as 'large near and
        small far', 'clear view' and 'distant view', but fully displays the
        content of the picture, which can be described as 'painting within
        painting, view within view'. The artwork is logical, clear, thematic,
        pleasing to the eye and charming.
