            <br />
            Ningbo has a long history of lacquerware craftsmanship. This is
            evidenced by a wooden bowl painted with vermilion lacquer that was
            unearthed at the 7,000-year-old Hemudu site.
            <br />
            In the ancient times in Ningbo, country houses often stocked up on
            large quantities of wood, ready to be put to use when marrying their
            daughters or brides. The parents of the man's family would make a
            large wooden sleeping bed for their son before marrying the
            daughter-in-law; the woman's family would make the red dress
            furniture. Both families make bamboo and wooden utensils, and when
            they are finished, they are decorated. In order to make the exterior
            of the utensils colourful, the craft method of mud and gold lacquer
            is often chosen, i.e. stacking, leaching and mud and gold painting
            on the wooden lacquer embryo.

          First, the geographical location is superior. Ningbo is located in the
          southeast coast, north of the Ning-Shao plain, southwest of the
          semi-hilly area, rich in forestry resources, the early opening of
          foreign ports, one of the earliest "five ports" of commerce, frequent
          overseas trade, exchange is very wide, conducive to the development of
          Yong-style furniture to the outside world, rich in local
          characteristics of the clay gold lacquer ware favoured by domestic and
          foreign merchants, which is the formation of This is one of the
          reasons for the splendour of mud and gold lacquerware.

          <div class="mud-row-body">
            The purpose of collecting milk is to suckle a child, and to collect
            milk also means to "collect a child", to have a child. The addition
            of a "milk bucket" to a woman's dowry is an auspicious sign that she
            will have a son.

            Secondly, there is a deep cultural deposit. Ningbo has thousands of
            years of Hemudu culture, plus a long, far-reaching and solid wedding
            culture, in order to show that the family is rich and wealthy, men
            and women in the wedding to make a big deal, compared with each
            other, show off each other, is the ordinary people also want to pour
            all their money to buy a dowry, in order to boast in the neighbours
            and show the grand wedding of their children, so that greatly
            promote the market demand for Yong-style wedding furniture. Ninghai,
            located in the south of Ningbo, is known as "seven mountains, two
            waters, one field", rich in human resources, so the history of
            manual "five artisans" is more developed, in the spare time of
            farming, the vast majority of master craftsmen with apprentices to
            travel north and south to do dowry for people, a small scale of The
            workshops transported the finished products to Taizhou, Ningbo and
            other areas for sale, and slowly expanded to the surrounding areas
            such as Ning, Shao and Tai, so that the art of mud and gold lacquer
            was brought into full play in the wedding furniture, forming a
            wonder in the category of practical furniture decoration.
            <br />
            Thirdly, it has a wide range of applications. It can be widely used
            as a surface decoration for domestic buildings and everyday
            utensils, and as a display for artworks in halls. The choice of
            subject matter is flexible and the plasticity of the art is strong,
            whether it is historical figures, fish, insects, birds, animals or
            flowers, whether it is a group or a single pile, regardless of the
            complexity or simplicity of the shape of the object, it can be
            adapted to the local situation and played at will. The longevity and
            durability of the work, which has endured for thousands of years, is
            evidenced by the clay and gold lacquer of the Shokura-in Temple in
            Japan.

            It has been proven that in Ninghai, in ancient times, the rich and
            well-off countryside families often chose mud and gold lacquer
            furniture and supplies when men married women, and this became a
            custom over time: before the man's parents married their
            daughter-in-law, they had to make a large wooden mud and gold
            lacquer bed for their son; the woman's family had to buy festive mud
            and gold lacquer furniture, such as boxes, baskets and hat buckets,
            and so on.
            <br />
            Mud and gold lacquer is closely related to the life of the local
            people. There is a wide variety of lacquer, ranging from furniture
            such as sleeping beds and cupboards to household utensils such as
            buckets, fruit boxes and hat buckets, reflecting the habits and
            customs of the people. The Ming and Qing dynasties and the
            Republican period furniture and household utensils preserved in
            Ningbo today are as bright as new, showing the exquisite handcrafted
            skills of the time.
