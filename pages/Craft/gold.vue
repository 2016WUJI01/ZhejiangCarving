        <div class="gold-row-title">A brief description is as follows</div>
        <div class="gold-row-body">
          The main technique is to apply gold and lacquer to the wood carving,
          which is centred in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, extending to Cixi,
          Yuyao, Fenghua, Xiangshan, Ninghai, Zhenhai, Yinzhou and other places.
          The real meaning of Ningbo Zhujin wood carving originated from the Han
          Dynasty, when the art of carving and lacquering and gold leaf appliqué
          was applied to buildings and decorative wood carvings in the Tang
          Dynasty, and gradually shifted to furniture and screens after the Ming
          and Qing Dynasties, due to the restrictions of the architectural
          system.

        <div class="gold-row-body">
          According to the History of Japan-China Cultural Exchanges by Japanese
          scholar Taiko Kimiya, a lacquered gold carved box was given as a gift
          to Japan by the government of Mingzhou during the Southern Song
          Dynasty. Legend has it that when the Tang Dynasty monk Jianzhen and
          his disciples built the Zhaoti Temple in Japan, they made reference to
          the wood carving decoration of the Ashoka Temple in Ningbo, where the
          decorative styles of the Hall of Sutra and the Hall of Relics were
          very similar to the domestic vermilion and gold wood carvings. "It was
          used in everyday life, from decoration on a regular basis, to the
          decoration of temple buildings and the beautification of residential
          houses, and especially in wedding ceremonies, where it was used in
          beds and palanquins.

        <div class="gold-row-body">
          Ningbo is located on the shores of the East China Sea and in the
          southeastern corner of the Yangtze River Delta, on the Ning-Shao
          Plain, at a moderate latitude, in the northern subtropical monsoon
          climate zone, mild and humid. In the 1970s archaeologists discovered
          wooden lacquer bowls and lacquer cylinders at the primitive social
          site of Hemudu in Yuyao, Zhejiang.
          <br />
          The General History of Zhejiang records that "During the Xuande period
          of the Ming Dynasty (1426~1435), Ningbo was famous for its clay and
          gold coloured lacquer mistysia and gold lacquer ware ......." It is
          clear that Ningbo has always produced lacquerware products in
          abundance. Lacquerware is best preserved in a place with slightly
          higher ambient humidity and at a temperature of around 15°C to 35°C.
          This is because if the air is too dry, the lacquer is prone to
          fracture; too much humidity makes it prone to deformation and paint
          stripping. The climatic conditions in Ningbo have provided objective
          conditions for the development of Zhujin wood carving.

          "The bed is also known as the 'Ningbo Carved Flower Bed', measuring
          212 cm in length and 120 cm in width; the step is 28 cm in depth and
          28 cm in height. The bed has a roll-topped roof and a footstep
          underneath, with a portico consisting of a carved pillar frame, a
          hanging drop, and a leaning eave with a flower cover in front. A small
          cupboard with two buckets and two doors is placed to the right of the
          portico, with a bell, hatbox, vase, mirror box, tea set and lampstand;
          a toilet box is placed to the right. The rear half is the bed itself,
          with a carved door cover, draped belt and pillows, and a carved and
          painted screen with expanded panels around three sides of the bed.

          The treadle bed is not only warm in winter and cool in summer, but
          also creates a versatile and private living space in the interior.
          Inside and outside the bed is like a pavilion, and there is a dressing
          table, a snack box, a stationery box and a toilet and other household
          utensils, with carvings and paintings around the bed and layers of
          pavilion hangings outside the bed, with gold and vermilion lacquer.

          "From the Southern Song Dynasty onwards, the folklore of Ningbo girls
          getting married in sedan chairs became more and more popular, and the
          sedan chairs became more and more elaborate. The palanquin now in
          Ningbo has a seven-storey pavilion and five main pavilions, which is
          called "Wuyue Chaotian".

          <br />
          It is decorated with vermilion gold carvings, and then lined with
          embroidery, beads, tassels and lenses. Hundreds of small figures are
          also carved on the palanquin, so the palanquin is also known as the
          'Hundred Children's Palanquin'. The palanquin is made of wood, with a
          vermilion lacquer base, gold foil appliqué, laminated with lenses, and
          is exquisite and transparent, with its structure symmetrical from
          front to back, left to right, fine and elaborate, with the top divided
          into seven layers. The palanquin reflects auspicious themes and
          historical figures such as the Heavenly Palace bestowing blessings,
          the unicorn sending a son, the Kui Xing pointing the scholar, and Wang
          Xizhi's love of geese.
