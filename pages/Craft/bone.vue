            The inlay is made of ivory, boxwood, mahogany, pearwood, cow bone,
            inlay, copper and wax stone, etc. The inlay is made by grooving the
            wood, then polishing and carving and painting. This technique is
            often found on furniture, screens, stationery and everyday objects,
            and has strong local characteristics. It has a long history and is
            renowned for its exquisite skills.

          <div class="bone-row-body">
            The history of bone and wood inlay in Ningbo can be traced back as
            far as the Longshan culture. For example, on an inlaid coffin
            excavated at the Yin ruins in Anyang, Henan province, one can find a
            mixture of animal bone and inlay. According to records, bone and
            wood inlay was included in the Yin dynasty as one of the 'six
            crafts' (i.e. earth, gold, stone, jade and animal grass). The bone
            and wood inlay process has spread widely in China, with the popular
            Xinjiang musical instrument "hot wap" having been decorated with
            bone inlay; Yangzhou lacquerware has also seen bone inlay; Beijing,
            Han, Guangdong and other prosperous places have seen bone inlay
            spread more frequently, but it is Ningbo that has been passed down
            through the generations, flourishing and innovating. During the Sui
            and Tang dynasties, bone and wood inlay began to flourish in Ningbo.
            During the Southern Song Dynasty, Ningbo became a major port for
            foreign trade with its convenient land and water transportation, and
            commerce and handicrafts flourished, including the rapid expansion
            of the wooden furniture making industry, in addition to the rich raw
            materials of fish glue, cattle bones and shells along the east coast
            of Zhejiang, which led to the development of the bone and wood inlay
            industry in Ningbo, and gradually formed a unique style of Ningbo
            bone and wood inlay craft.

            Bone wood mosaics cover a wide range of categories and are highly
            practical, including traditional furniture, household items and
            architectural decorations for doors and windows. The common themes
            of bone and wood inlay works include folklore, historical stories,
            customs, plum, orchids, bamboo and chrysanthemums, and the two
            immortals (Hanshan and Goude), etc. The intention is to express
            auspiciousness, and the traditional Chinese culture has a rich and
            colourful content. Modern bone and wood inlay techniques are used to
            show the world the elegance of Zhuoyao. Representative works include
            "The Red Chamber", "The Hundred Beautiful Ladies", "The Lantern
            Festival" and "Mu Guiying Practising War". These are valuable export
            crafts.

            The artistic value of Ningbo bone and wood inlay is expressed in the
            composition and carving skills of the bone and wood inlay. The
            images come from two sources, one is the "Danqing style", which is a
            copy of the works of calligraphers and painters of the time, and is
            highly pictorial. The other is the so-called "ancient style"
            designed by folk artists through experience. The layout of this type
            of composition absorbs the characteristics of folk paintings such as
            the Yangliuqing woodblock prints and the stone carvings of Han Wu
            and Liang Ke and the painted bricks of Han tomb murals, and is
            strongly decorative. Whether sparse or dense, it must be
            well-proportioned, and the layout with figures as the subject should
            be so that people and scenery are in harmony; those with landscape
            as the subject should be so that the landscape and clouds reflect
            each other, and it adopts a scattered perspective, which is not
            limited by space in the picture, the images do not overlap, and the
            foreground and backdrop appear on a single plane, which is suitable
            for showing complex scenes and the natural proportions of objects
            and scenery. The long or horizontal panels are formed by borrowing
            buildings to form natural intervals, or by interlocking mountain and
            rock scenes to link a plot together, forming a continuous comic
            strip or an independent and complete work of art, a masterpiece of
            ancient working people's wisdom.　In terms of carving techniques,
            the bone inlays are exquisite and the carving is skillful. The
            images are set off in black and white to show the effect of
            silhouette and are decorative in a folkloric way. This form is
            closely related to its craft.
